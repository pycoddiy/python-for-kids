![Screenshot](../screenshots/05_border_control.jpg)

Script: `05_border_control.py`

Keep objects inside the window by clamping position.

## Run

```bash
python 05_border_control.py
```

## Concepts

- Window bounds (left/right/top/bottom)
- Clamping position after movement

## Ideas to try

- Add screen wrap (appear on the other side)
- Bounce off the edges instead of stopping
