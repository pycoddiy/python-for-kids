# 06 Geometry Awareness

![Screenshot](../screenshots/06_geometry_awareness.jpg)

Script: `06_geometry_awareness.py`

Collision with window edges and staying inside the play area. Used as a baseline for later demos.

## Run

```bash
python 06_geometry_awareness.py
```

## Concepts

- Position (x/y) vs edges (left/right/top/bottom)
- Limiting movement at boundaries

## Ideas to try

- Add a margin so the player/shape doesn't touch the edges
- Show coordinates on screen for learning
