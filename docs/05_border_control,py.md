# 05 Border Control (typo in filename)

Script: `05_border_control,py` (note the comma in the filename)

Keep objects inside the window by clamping position.

## Run

```bash
python '05_border_control,py'
```

Tip: Because the filename has a comma, quotes help avoid shell confusion.

## Concepts

- Window bounds (left/right/top/bottom)
- Clamping position after movement

## Ideas to try

- Add screen wrap (appear on the other side)
- Bounce off the edges instead of stopping
