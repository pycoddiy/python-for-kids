Script: `04_press_release.py`

Practice reading press and release separately to start/stop movement.

## Run

```bash
python 04_press_release.py
```

## Concepts

- Tracking pressed state booleans
- Avoiding “sticky keys”

## Ideas to try

- Add jump on key press
- Add different speeds for held vs tapped
